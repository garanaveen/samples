# Scene Graph Developer Extensions

## Installation

Follow these steps to prepare your channel to use SGDEX components:

* Copy the `SGDEX` folder into your channel so that the path to the folder is `pkg:/components/SGDEX`. _This path is required for certain graphic elements to work correctly._
* Copy `SGDEX.brs` into your channel so that the path to the file is `pkg:/source/SGDEX.brs`
* Add this line to your manifest: `bs_libs_required=roku_ads_lib`

You are now ready to use SGDEX components in your channel!
